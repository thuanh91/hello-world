# hello-world
Analytics 502 Project
Hello there! I am Thu Luc. This is my first time learning so much about statistics and coding. Even though I never thought I could understand much about technology, I recently realized that I absolutely could, and I could do much better. I found motivation learning about technology from real benefits it can bring to our lives. It also makes people feel like they are smart learning about it!
